# IntraDom Network Web Hosting Panel

IDN WHP is a simple administration panel build with Symfony and EasyAdmin to manage the configuration of virtual hosts in [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) (latest stable releases recommended).

It supports multiple:
* domains and aliases,
* [PHP](https://www.php.net/) versions,
* system users (with isolation in Apache thanks to [MPM-ITK](http://mpm-itk.sesse.net/)),
* IP addresses,
* SSL certificates (no built-in renewal support).

With console commands, it helps to configure repositories and install packages.

In addition, the database is tuned to support virtual accounts via [ProFTPd](http://www.proftpd.org/) - to be improved in the futureâ€¦
